## [2.2.0] - 2026-09-07

Evidence honesty. A review of the project against established PostgreSQL tooling
found six places where the numbers on screen claimed more than they had measured;
this release fixes all of them, and makes result verification both cheaper and
stronger while doing it.

### Breaking

- **`POST /api/v1/queries/explain/compare` renames the cost row and changes its format.**
  `Total cost … −26.9×` is now `Planner cost (estimate) … −96.3%`. Cost is an abstract
  quantity the planner uses to choose between plans — scaled page-fetch units, not
  proportional to elapsed time and not reliably comparable across plans — so rendering it
  as a fold change beside an execution-time row asserted a speedup the number cannot
  support. It is now a percentage, never an `N×`, and carries a caveat saying so. Anything
  parsing the `evidence` string or expecting `×` in `change` for that row must be updated.

### Added

- **`timing_runs` on compare (1–5, default 1).** Above 1, each side runs that many times
  under ANALYZE and the row reports the **median** with the observed range —
  `28ms (5 runs, 26ms–40ms)`. The median rather than the mean, so one cold or contended
  run cannot drag the figure to a number no execution produced.
- **Noise detection.** When the run-to-run spread is at least as large as the gap between
  the medians, the tool says the result is inside the measurement noise rather than
  printing a confident percentage.
- **`caveat` on `PlanComparisonMetric`.** Rendered inline beneath the number, and carried
  into exported reports, so a PDF says what the screen says.
- **`EXPLAIN (SETTINGS)` on every plan.** Non-default planner configuration —
  `random_page_cost`, `work_mem`, a disabled `enable_seqscan` — changes both the plan
  chosen and every cost shown, so a comparison is only meaningful when both sides were
  produced under the same settings. Costs no extra execution and does not imply ANALYZE.

### Changed

- **Result verification is roughly twice as cheap and no longer capped.** It ran four
  executions, and past 1000 rows sampled with `ORDER BY md5(row::text) LIMIT 1000` — a hash
  of every row plus a top-N sort of the entire result, on a query the user already
  considers too slow. It is now one aggregate pass per side:

  ```sql
  SELECT count(*), sum(hashtextextended(t::text, 0)), bit_xor(hashtextextended(t::text, 0))
  FROM (<query>) t
  ```

  No sort, three scalars on the wire, two executions instead of four. All three aggregates
  are commutative, so row order cannot affect the answer, and together they separate
  multisets any one would miss. **`VerifiedEqual` now means every row was compared, at any
  result size** — previously anything past 1000 rows could only ever be `SampleMatch`.
  The count-plus-sample path remains as a fallback, so `SampleMatch` is still reachable and
  the status enum is unchanged.
- **Execution time is labelled as the single sample it is** when `timing_runs` is 1.
- **The demo seeds 300k rows (~55 MB) instead of 8000.** At ~160 rows per partition the
  whole table sat in shared buffers, partition pruning saved microseconds, and run-to-run
  variance exceeded the difference being reported — the same query measured 2ms and 6ms on
  consecutive runs. The comparison now reports 24ms → 7ms. Seeding takes about 2 seconds;
  the 10M-row path (`make seed-large-docker`) is unchanged.

### Fixed

- **The "no rewrite offered" message was wrong and discouraging.** It omitted the
  `LEFT JOIN … IS NULL` → `NOT EXISTS` pattern and listed `COALESCE` unqualified when only
  `COALESCE` over a date column is handled. It now lists every pattern accurately and says
  that declining is the normal outcome, not a failure.
- **Release signature verification instructions.** Artifacts are signed as Sigstore v0.3
  bundles, which cosign v2 cannot read — it fails with `bundle does not contain cert for
  verification`, which reads like a bad signature rather than a version mismatch. The
  README now states that cosign v3 or newer is required and quotes the error.

### Documentation

- The README leads with the capability that is actually differentiated — proposing a
  rewrite and then proving the rows still match — and states plainly that the rewriter is a
  rule engine over PostgreSQL's parser with about six patterns, that it declines more often
  than it fires, and that a query outside those shapes yields plan findings and no rewrite.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-09-06

Query Investigation: propose a rewrite, prove it with the planner, and verify the rows still
match — plus a remediation pass over every place the tool previously overstated what it had
actually checked.

### Breaking

- **`POST /api/v1/queries/explain` no longer returns `execution_time_ms`.** The field reported
  the server's wall-clock time for the EXPLAIN round trip — network, planning, and parsing —
  even when the query was never executed, so it read as an execution time that nothing had
  measured. It is replaced by four honest fields: `request_wall_time_ms` (the round trip),
  `planning_time_ms` and `server_execution_time_ms` (PostgreSQL's own numbers, the latter
  non-zero only under ANALYZE), and `evidence_mode` (`estimated` or `observed`). Clients
  generated from the v2.0.0 OpenAPI spec must regenerate. This is the only field removed
  anywhere in the API in this release.

### Added

- **Query Investigation workflow:** open an investigation from SQL or a `pg_stat_statements`
  regression, get a verdict-first plan diagnosis, propose rewrite candidates, rank them with a
  dry EXPLAIN, and compare before/after plans.
- **Rewrite patterns:** `DATE_TRUNC` equality → sargable range, `LEFT JOIN … IS NULL` anti-join
  → `NOT EXISTS`, `OR` → `UNION`, and parameterized-query rewrites with `EXPLAIN (GENERIC_PLAN)`.
- **Result equivalence:** a compare can execute both queries and report a five-state status —
  `VerifiedEqual`, `SampleMatch`, `Different`, `Unverified`, `NotRequested` — using `COUNT(*)`
  plus an order-independent multiset fingerprint.
- **Index advice with hypopg:** planner-backed cost projection for a candidate index, labelled
  `hypopg` when real and `heuristic` when not, so a guess is never presented as a measurement.
- **Regression poller:** rolling baseline, self-observation filter, and an applied-fix lifecycle,
  polling every authorized connection with advisory-lock leader election.
- **Report export:** Markdown, JSON, and SQL, alongside HTML and PDF. PDF embeds a Unicode font.
- **Candidate history:** every tested candidate is kept, not just the winner.
- **Sample bind values** for comparing parameterized queries.
- **Security & Trust page** reports live per-connection posture: real TLS mode, real allowed
  schemas, real timeout and row cap, a live read-only probe, and the caller's actual permissions.

### Changed

- **Investigations use estimate-only EXPLAIN by default.** ANALYZE executes the query, so it is
  now opt-in per request rather than implied by opening an investigation.
- **Candidate ranking is honest about "no improvement."** A candidate that beats nothing gets no
  rank, and the list carries an explicit `recommendation` when nothing improves.
- **Regression detection compares poll-to-poll interval deltas**, not cumulative
  `pg_stat_statements` counters, whose percent changes grew with uptime until they always fired.
- **"Rows scanned" counts actual rows across loops** instead of the maximum at any single node.
- **Investigations are org-wide by design**; deletion is gated on `created_by`.
- **One deployment model:** the root `Dockerfile` is the blessed single image (API plus built
  SPA). The divergent `deploy/docker/` variant is removed.

### Fixed

- **`DATE_TRUNC('month', col) = '2025-01-15'` is no longer rewritten.** The predicate is
  unsatisfiable; widening it to the whole month changed the result set.
- **`OR` → `UNION` no longer drops NULL rows.** The generated branch negated the previous
  predicate with a plain `NOT`, which discards rows where it evaluates to NULL; it now uses
  `IS NOT TRUE`.
- **Bind substitution is hardened against injection.** The timestamp pattern was unanchored and
  quotes were not escaped, so a value beginning like a timestamp could inject a predicate.
- **Result verification requires the `query` permission,** not just `explain` — it executes rows.
- **Regression alerts cannot duplicate:** a partial unique index permits one open alert per
  (organization, connection, queryid).
- **Cross-organization integrity** for investigation children, via composite foreign keys.
- **Webhook retry backoff no longer overflows.** `base * 2^attempt` wrapped negative past attempt
  29, which would have scheduled a retry in the past.
- **Demo scenarios derive dates from the live dataset** instead of hardcoded literals that aged
  out and returned zero rows.
- **A fresh deploy of the container image now completes its migrations.** The entrypoint ran
  them as `DATABASE_USER`, the runtime role — which deliberately cannot create extensions or
  `ALTER ROLE`, because it also executes user SQL. Every fresh install stopped at migration
  `000019` with `permission denied to create extension "pg_stat_statements"`, so `docker compose
  up` on a clean volume, and any first deploy of the published image, could not work. Set
  `DATABASE_MIGRATION_USER` / `DATABASE_MIGRATION_PASSWORD` (or `DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL`) to a
  role that may; unset, behaviour is unchanged for an already-migrated database.
- **Migrations fail loudly on stale or dirty state,** with the recovery command printed.
- **Partition findings collapse even without a schema prefix.** The normalizer required
  `schema.table_YYYY_MM`, but EXPLAIN reports a bare relation when `search_path` resolves it,
  so those findings never grouped and reports listed one line per partition.
- **Plan-finding collapse in the UI** no longer folds a scan of the parent table into its own
  partition group, no longer labels plain duplicates as partitions, no longer drops the repeat
  count for non-partition duplicates, and no longer strips the month from a lone partition.
- **Rollback no longer breaks on a database that has been used.** The down migrations for
  `000008` (audit event types) and `000042` (SQL storage class) re-added a narrowed `CHECK`
  that is validated against existing rows, so any deployment that had served an HTTP request
  or enabled SQL encryption could not roll back past them. Both now add the constraint
  `NOT VALID`: enforced on new writes, and history is left intact rather than rewritten —
  which for an audit log would have falsified the record, and for encrypted snapshots would
  have relabelled ciphertext as plaintext.

### Security

- Read-only boundary is verified with hypopg's read-only lift in play: writes and DDL must still
  fail on privilege, not merely on the `transaction_read_only` flag.
- `golang.org/x/crypto` and the CI/Docker Go toolchain bumped to clear `govulncheck`.
- The security policy now states the guarantees the boundary is meant to keep, so a reproducible
  break in any of them is recognisably a vulnerability, along with the limits that are deliberate
  (notably that `APP_ENV=demo` fabricates workspace KPIs).

### Internal

- Coverage floors raised to sit just under measured values (`app/service` 12 → 25,
  `app/queryrunner` 40 → 65, `app/security` 40 → 50, `app/audit` 20 → 45, core total 18 → 35).
- `make test-unit` now runs `app/service`, `app/security`, `app/llm`, `app/audit` and `app/story`,
  which previously executed only inside the CI coverage step.
- Documentation is gated on `mkdocs build --strict`. Enabling `attr_list` fixed twelve dead
  cross-page anchors whose explicit heading ids had been rendering as literal text.
- `make generate` strips goa's seeded OpenAPI examples — roughly 97% of those artifacts. A
  one-field design change went from rewriting 55,441 lines to 14, so the specs are diffable
  again and no longer hidden behind `-diff`.
- **Release artifacts are signed with Sigstore bundles.** `cosign sign-blob` was still being
  called with `--output-signature`/`--output-certificate`, which current cosign deprecates and
  then ignores in favour of `--bundle`; with no bundle path it failed on the first artifact and
  skipped release creation entirely. Each archive, `checksums.txt` and the SBOM now ship a
  `.cosign.bundle` alongside them, and the README documents `cosign verify-blob`.
- **The release pipeline works.** `actions/download-artifact` was pinned to a SHA that does not
  exist upstream, so a tag push built every binary and then died in "Set up job" before
  publishing anything. `Lint` now resolves every pinned action SHA on each pull request —
  including multi-segment paths like `github/codeql-action/init` — failing only on 404/422 so a
  GitHub API outage cannot wedge every open PR.
- **The repository is no longer 94% committed dependencies.** `frontend/node_modules` (11,147
  files) and a stale `frontend/dist` were tracked despite every build running `npm ci`. Tracked
  files went from 11,909 to 742, and a shallow clone from 205 MB to 9.3 MB.
- Documentation is published to GitHub Pages from `main`.

- **Production ops docs:** Backup, migrations, monitoring (see deployment/operations reference docs).
- **Multiple database connections:** `GET /api/v1/connections`, plus optional `connection_id` across run/save/list/report/schema/ask flows. Saved queries and reports persist `connection_id`.
- **Structured logging (zerolog):** `LOG_LEVEL` (debug, info, warn, error) and `LOG_PRETTY` for local dev. One message per request (`http request`), with level by status: 4xx/5xx → error; `/health`, `/ready`, `/version` → debug; else info.
- **Configurable metrics windows:** `METRICS_MAX_TIMESERIES_PERIODS` (default 24, range 2–120) caps the periods included in time-series output.

### Changed

- README and public positioning lead with Postgres query intelligence; AI narrative layer is optional.
- `default_transaction_read_only` enforced on the read-only database role (migration 000011).
- Documentation refreshed across configuration, API reference and examples, UI overview, quick start, CLI usage, and troubleshooting to match multi-connection behaviour and current request/response fields.

## [1.0.0]

### Planned (Release 2)

Additional analytics: further cohort metrics, configurable windows, and seasonal adjustments.

### Added
- **Isolation Forest anomaly detection:** `METRICS_ANOMALY_METHOD=isolation_forest` now supported; calculator branches on method and uses Isolation Forest (random trees, median split, anomaly score) when set; z-score remains default
